        <p class="font3">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert
            information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or
            secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example
            is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw,
            heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and
            limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted
            spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.

            The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage.
            Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands,
            such as English or/and Spanish.

            One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written,
            is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or
            the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers.
            Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.

        Main article: Coding theory
        In information theory and computer science, a code is usually considered as an algorithm that uniquely
        represents symbols from some source alphabet, by encoded strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An
        extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by
        concatenating the encoded strings.

        Before giving a mathematically precise definition, this is a brief example. The mapping

        {\displaystyle C=\{\,a\mapsto 0,b\mapsto 01,c\mapsto 011\,\}}C = \{\, a\mapsto 0, b\mapsto 01, c\mapsto 011\,\}
        is a code, whose source alphabet is the set {\displaystyle \{a,b,c\}}\{a,b,c\} and whose target alphabet is the
        set {\displaystyle \{0,1\}}\{0,1\}. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string 0011001011 can be
        grouped into codewords as 0 011 0 01 011, and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols
        acabc.

        Using terms from formal language theory, the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let
        S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target alphabets, respectively. A code {\displaystyle C:\,S\to
        T^{*}}C:\, S \to T^* is a total function mapping each symbol from S to a sequence of symbols over T, and the
        extension of {\displaystyle C}C to a homomorphism of {\displaystyle S^{*}}S^{*} into {\displaystyle T^{*}}T^{*},
        which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols, is referred to as its
        extension.

        Variable-length codes
        Main article: Variable-length code
        In this section, we consider codes that encode each source (clear text) character by a code word from some
        dictionary, and concatenation of such code words give us an encoded string. Variable-length codes are especially
        useful when clear text characters have different probabilities; see also entropy encoding.

        A prefix code is a code with the "prefix property": there is no valid code word in the system that is a prefix
        (start) of any other valid code word in the set. Huffman coding is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix
        codes. Prefix codes are widely referred to as "Huffman codes" even when the code was not produced by a Huffman
        algorithm. Other examples of prefix codes are country calling codes, the country and publisher parts of ISBNs,
        and the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the UMTS WCDMA 3G Wireless Standard.

        Kraft's inequality characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually any
        uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessarily a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.

        Error-correcting codes
        Main article: Error detection and correction
        See also: Block code
        Codes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage. This
        so-called error-correcting code works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted)
        data. Examples include Hamming codes, Reed–Solomon, Reed–Muller, Walsh–Hadamard, Bose–Chaudhuri–Hochquenghem,
        Turbo, Golay, Goppa, low-density parity-check codes, and space–time codes. Error detecting codes can be
        optimised to detect burst errors, or random errors.

        Examples
        Codes in communication used for brevity
        A cable code replaces words (e.g. ship or invoice) with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent
        with fewer characters, more quickly, and less expensively.

        Codes can be used for brevity. When telegraph messages were the state of the art in rapid long-distance
        communication, elaborate systems of commercial codes that encoded complete phrases into single mouths (commonly
        five-minute groups) were developed so that telegraphers became conversant with such "words" as BYOXO ("Are you
        trying to weasel out of our deal?"), LIOUY ("Why do you not answer my question?"), BMULD ("You're a skunk!"), or
        AYYLU ("Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly."). Code words were chosen for various reasons: length,
        pronounceability, etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for
        military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for espionage codes.
        Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front for the American Black Chamber run
        by Herbert Yardley between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of these codes was to save on
        cable costs. The use of data coding for data compression predates the computer era; an early example is a
        telegraph Morse code where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as
        Huffman coding are now used by computer-based algorithms to compress large data files into a more compact form
        for storage or transmission.</p>
